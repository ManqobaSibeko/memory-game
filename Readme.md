### Description

- On the game board, there are always two identical images behind each block. 
- Start the game by flipping a card(click a block).
- Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. 
- Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play. When you find a pair they are removed from the board and when you find all the pairs in this memory, you have completed the level
